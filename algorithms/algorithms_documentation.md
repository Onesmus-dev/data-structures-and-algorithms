This document provides a brief overview of the algorithms implemented so far in the algorithms folder of the data-structures-and-algorithms repository.

Implemented Algorithms:

Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. (Likely implemented in bubble_sort.py)
Insertion Sort: An efficient sorting algorithm that builds the sorted list one element at a time. It iterates through the list, comparing each element with the sorted sub-list and inserting it at its correct position. (Likely implemented in insertionSort.py)
Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot, partitions the list around the pivot, and recursively sorts the sub-lists. (Likely implemented in quick_sort.py)
Lumoto Partitioning (Optional): This file might contain the lumoto.py implementation, which is a specific partitioning scheme commonly used in Quick Sort.
